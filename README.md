# Test Action

test Action allows you to integrate Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) into your CI/CD pipelines. 
test Action leverages test Bridge, a foundational piece of technology that has built-in knowledge of how to run all major test security testing solutions, plus common workflows for platforms like GitHub.

To use test Action, please follow the steps below:

1. Configure GitHub as described in the [GitHub Prerequisites](https://sig-product-docs.test.com/bundle/bridge/page/documentation/c_github-prerequisites.html) page.
2. Install and configure test Action for the test product you are using. <br/>
